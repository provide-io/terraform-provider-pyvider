# Garnish System Improvements

## Overview

The garnish system has been significantly improved to provide better documentation generation capabilities for pyvider components. These improvements enhance the developer experience by automating documentation scaffold creation and rendering.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Scaffold Command

The `soup garnish scaffold` command now supports component-type filtering:

```bash
soup garnish scaffold --component-type resource
soup garnish scaffold --component-type data_source
soup garnish scaffold --component-type function
```

This allows developers to selectively generate documentation scaffolds for specific component types, making it easier to manage large component libraries.

### 2. Automatic Component Discovery

The garnish system now automatically discovers all registered components in the pyvider ecosystem:
- Resources
- Data sources  
- Functions

It intelligently identifies components that are missing documentation and creates appropriate scaffold structures.

### 3. Improved Directory Structure

For each component, garnish creates a well-organized directory structure:

```
component_name.garnish/
├── docs/
│   └── component_name.tmpl.md    # Documentation template
└── examples/
    └── example.tf                 # Usage examples
```

### 4. Template Generation

The system generates smart documentation templates that include:
- Component name and type
- Schema information placeholders
- Argument documentation sections
- Attribute documentation sections
- Example usage sections

### 5. Batch Processing

Both `scaffold` and `render` commands now process all components in batch, providing:
- Progress indicators
- Success/failure reporting
- Summary statistics

## Usage Examples

### Scaffolding Missing Documentation

```bash
# Scaffold all missing documentation
soup garnish scaffold

# Scaffold only for resources
soup garnish scaffold --component-type resource

# Scaffold for multiple types
soup garnish scaffold --component-type resource --component-type function
```

### Rendering Documentation

```bash
# Render all documentation from templates
soup garnish render
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All components follow the same documentation structure
2. **Automation**: Reduces manual documentation effort
3. **Discoverability**: Makes it easy to identify undocumented components
4. **Maintainability**: Templates can be updated centrally
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with the pyvider component system

## Technical Details

The garnish system is implemented in the TofuSoup package and integrates with:
- Pyvider's component discovery system
- The hub registry for component metadata
- Template rendering engines for documentation generation

The improvements ensure that all pyvider components can have comprehensive, consistent documentation with minimal manual effort.

## New Test Command

### 6. Automated Example Testing

The new `soup garnish test` command dynamically assembles and runs all garnish examples as a complete test suite:

```bash
# Run all garnish examples
soup garnish test

# Run only resource examples
soup garnish test --component-type resource

# Run with custom parallelism
soup garnish test --parallel 8

# Use custom output directory
soup garnish test --output-dir .my-tests
```

#### How It Works

1. **Dynamic Assembly**: The command discovers all `.garnish` directories and their example files
2. **Test Suite Generation**: For each component with examples:
   - Creates a test directory named `{component_type}_{component_name}_test`
   - Generates a standard `provider.tf` file
   - Copies example files with descriptive names
3. **Execution**: Uses the TofuSoup stir engine to run all tests in parallel
4. **Results**: Provides detailed pass/fail statistics and error reporting

#### Example Output

```
🧪 Running garnish example tests...
🚀 Tofusoup Stir
Found 5 test suites in '.garnish-tests'. Running up to 2 in parallel...

📊 Test Results:
  Total: 5
  ✅ Passed: 3
  ❌ Failed: 2

❌ Failed tests:
  - resource_file_content_test: Missing required argument
  - resource_timed_token_test: Missing required argument
```

This feature enables continuous testing of all provider examples, ensuring documentation stays accurate and examples remain functional.
