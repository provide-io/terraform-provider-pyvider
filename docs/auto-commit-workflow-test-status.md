# Auto-Commit Workflow Testing - Current Status

## Executive Summary

We are currently testing a workflow to manage private repositories with auto-commits that can be squashed for clean public releases. This is part of the Terraform Provider Pyvider project's CI/CD strategy.

## Background Context

The user requested a workflow where:
1. **Private Repository**: Contains development history with auto-commits (marked with 🔼⚙️ [skip ci] auto-commit)
2. **Public Repository**: Contains clean, curated history without auto-commits
3. **Squashing Strategy**: Ability to consolidate auto-commits while preserving meaningful commits

## Current Test Environment

**Location**: `/tmp/workflow-test/test-private-repo/`

**Test Data Created**:
- 13 total commits (6 auto-commits + 7 regular commits)
- Auto-commits marked with: `🔼⚙️ [skip ci] auto-commit`
- Regular commits: features, fixes, documentation updates
- Mixed chronological order to simulate real development

**Repository State**:
```
Current branch: main
Status: clean
Auto-commits: 6
Regular commits: 7
```

## Testing Goals

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create test environment for auto-commit workflow
- [x] Simulate development with auto-commits

### Phase 2: ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Simulate development with auto-commits
- [x] Generate realistic mixed commit history

### Phase 3: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Test squashing strategies
  - [ ] Option 1: Create parallel clean branch with squashed history
  - [ ] Option 2: Script-based automated squashing
  - [ ] Option 3: Interactive rebase simulation

### Phase 4: ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Test merge scenarios
  - [ ] Merge clean branch back to main
  - [ ] Handle conflicts during merge
  - [ ] Preserve commit authorship and timestamps

### Phase 5: ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Run validation tests
  - [ ] Verify content integrity between branches
  - [ ] Test script automation
  - [ ] Document final workflow procedures

## Current Test Progress

**What We're Testing Now**:
Testing different squashing strategies to remove auto-commits while preserving meaningful development history.

**Current Command**: About to test Option 1 - parallel clean branch creation with selective commit picking.

**Expected Outcomes**:
1. Clean branch with only meaningful commits
2. Preserved commit metadata (author, timestamp, message)
3. Identical file content between branches
4. Automated script for repeatable process

## Technical Implementation Details

### Auto-Commit Detection Pattern
```bash
git log --oneline --grep="🔼⚙️.*auto-commit"
```

### Squashing Strategy Options
1. **Parallel Branch**: Create new branch, cherry-pick non-auto commits
2. **Interactive Rebase**: Use git rebase -i to squash auto-commits
3. **Script Automation**: Automated detection and consolidation

### Repository Structure
```
/tmp/workflow-test/
├── test-private-repo/          # Main test repository
│   ├── main.py                 # Test Python file with changes
│   └── README.md               # Test documentation
└── [future: test-public-repo/] # Will be created for public workflow testing
```

## Current Commit History Analysis

**Auto-commits (to be removed/squashed)**:
- 6 commits with pattern: "🔼⚙️ [skip ci] auto-commit"
- Generated during simulated development cycles
- Contain incremental changes that should be consolidated

**Regular commits (to be preserved)**:
- 7 meaningful commits with descriptive messages
- Feature additions, bug fixes, documentation
- Should maintain original authorship and timing

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Complete Phase 3**: Test all squashing strategies
2. **Validate Results**: Ensure content integrity after squashing
3. **Document Process**: Create reproducible scripts
4. **Test Merge**: Validate clean branch can merge back to main

## GitHub Actions Monitoring

**Background Processes**:
- 3 GitHub Actions workflows currently running
- Monitoring build and release pipeline status
- Pipeline IDs: 17870556347, 17870605666, 17870638361

## Files Modified During Testing

**Test Files**:
- `/tmp/workflow-test/test-private-repo/main.py`: 3 function definitions + 3 comment changes
- `/tmp/workflow-test/test-private-repo/README.md`: Simple test project documentation

## Success Criteria

**Phase 3 Success**:
- [ ] Clean branch created with 7 commits (no auto-commits)
- [ ] File content identical between branches
- [ ] Commit metadata preserved for meaningful commits
- [ ] Reproducible automated process

**Overall Success**:
- [ ] Complete workflow documented and tested
- [ ] Script automation working reliably
- [ ] User approval of final workflow design
- [ ] Integration with main project's development process

## Resumption Instructions

To continue this testing session:

1. **Current Directory**: `cd /tmp/workflow-test/test-private-repo`
2. **Current Task**: Execute squashing strategy testing (Phase 3)
3. **Next Command**: Test parallel branch creation with selective commit picking
4. **Background**: Monitor GitHub Actions workflows with `gh run watch`

## Related Project Context

This testing is part of the larger Terraform Provider Pyvider project located at:
`/Users/tim/code/gh/provide-io/terraform-provider-pyvider/`

**Project Status**:
- Successfully migrated from garnish → plating documentation system
- Fixed dependency issues with provide-foundation integration
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows
- Implemented architecture-specific provider binary naming
- Currently testing auto-commit management workflow

**User's Original Request**:
> "I need a workflow which manages private repositories with auto-commits that can be squashed for public release"

This test validates that workflow before implementing it in the main project.
