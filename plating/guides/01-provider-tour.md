# Tour the Example Provider

The `pyvider` Terraform provider packages a curated subset of the example components from the `pyvider-components` library. This tour highlights the major capability areas so you can decide which examples to try first.

## What's inside

- **Resources** for manipulating files, exercising Terraform workflows, and simulating infrastructure objects.
- **Data sources** for reading environment data, parsing inputs, and performing calculations.
- **Functions** that bring common Python-style utilities (string casing, formatting, math) directly into Terraform expressions.

Each component is documented in this site. Use the navigation pane to drill into the resource, data source, or function you want to inspect.

## File operations

Manage local files and directories without leaving Terraform:

- `pyvider_file_content` writes content to disk with optional templating helpers.
- `pyvider_local_directory` creates nested folder structures from Terraform data.
- `pyvider_file_info` removes guesswork by returning metadata about files on disk.

```terraform
resource "pyvider_file_content" "notes" {
  filename = "${path.module}/notes.txt"
  content = <<-EOT
    Generated by Terraform at ${timestamp()}
    Workspace: ${terraform.workspace}
  EOT
  mode = "0644"
}
```

## Diagnostics and helpers

Need quick insight into the runtime environment? Try:

- `pyvider_env_variables` to surface environment variables into Terraform.
- `pyvider_provider_config_reader` to echo back provider configuration when you are experimenting with custom capabilities.
- `pyvider_timed_token` to generate expiring tokens useful for test scenarios.

These components make it easy to confirm that your provider binary is wired correctly before building something more complex.

## Data transformation with jq

Pyvider includes first-class support for `jq`:

- `pyvider_lens_jq` data source executes a query over structured data.
- `provider::pyvider::lens_jq()` function lets you run the same queries inline.

```terraform
locals {
  raw = jsonencode({
    services = [
      { name = "api", tier = "backend" },
      { name = "web", tier = "frontend" },
    ]
  })
}

data "pyvider_lens_jq" "frontend" {
  json_input = local.raw
  query = ".services[] | select(.tier == \"frontend\") | .name"
}
```

## Test mode components

Want to understand how Pyvider handles diagnostics and state transitions? Explore the test-mode resources and data sources:

- `pyvider_private_state_verifier` and `pyvider_warning_example` simulate validation flows.
- `pyvider_nested_resource_test` and friends provide state-rich examples ideal for learning how updates and diffs work.

## Function library highlights

Try these Terraform functions for quick wins:

- `provider::pyvider::upper(value)` and `provider::pyvider::lower(value)` for case conversion.
- `provider::pyvider::format_size(bytes)` to present byte counts in human-readable units.
- `provider::pyvider::pluralize(word, count)` to tidy up generated text.

Because functions run wherever Terraform evaluates expressions, they are perfect for templating outputs or generating configuration files.
